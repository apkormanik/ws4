I do think that the means and/or variances of the helpfulness values does differ significantly between different products or customers.
For example, some customers may contribute a lot of reviews, but their helpfulness may be low.
Or, a product may not have many reviews, but the helpfulness of those reviews may be very high.
This can cause a lot of differences in means and variances.
